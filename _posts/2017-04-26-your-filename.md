Pretty interesting and this is the first time I came across the term JAMStack (a concept I always had trouble in explaining to other developers).
Rendering content blocks in server and then further enhancing them on client-side using a JSON API can be how most sites will be built in future (especially, with ServiceWorkers we would be able to create more fine-grained offline experience too).

Consider adding your project a list of headless cms's. I am hoping to expand the category and spread the JAM.
