product_detail: A platform to categorize and manage different kinds of orders the client receives on a daily basis. The platform which existed before lacked the usability and intuitiveness thus failing to make the users comfortable with the system. The revised UI/UX made the platform much more easier to use, resulting in much more improved user engagement.
