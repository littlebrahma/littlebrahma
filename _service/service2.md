- title: ILLUSTRATIONS
  description: As we draw inspiration from indigenous subjects and mythological tales,
    we bring the nativity in form and figure as we cherish our amazing history. Our
    illustrators  make  each  narrow  line  appear  as  if  it  was  magically  drawn  with
    finesse, and adding the talents of   prolific   inventiveness   and   technical
    versatility,  we  are  making  our  illustrations  deeply  influential.  We  could
    almost  be  asking  impressionism  to  revisit  us  again.  Enter  the  gallery  to  see
    what our upper crest has achieved, that is quintessentially modern.
- title: CHARACTER AND MASCOT
  description: If  there  is  anything  bigger  than  Olympics,  let  us  know.  We  have
    a  mascot ready  for  the  largest  of  the  large  events  that  humankind  wants  to  celebrate.
    Our characters are given the cheeky edge to make your brand have a name, a  face,  an  identity  and  most  importantly,  magnificence.  It  could  be  a
    character  for  the  next  biggest  product  launch  or  a  symbol  of  importance  for
    the  mega  merger  that  your  team  has  put  together.  Our  answers  speak  to  the
    world  through  our  creations,  and  that  means  making  your  brand  or  event  a
    talking point as the perfect example for times to come.
- title: PATTERNS
  description: Sometimes we don’t need colours to express our desires. Patterns truly
    can be read in between the lines. We take great pride in our patterns of thought
    and action, expressed in a kaleidoscopic palette that is enough to make the warpand
    the weft come to life. With our stylists and their army of intricate patterns
    derived  from  the  syncretic  culture,  combined  with  traditional  craft  and
    ornamental  murals  bring  out  the  most  enduring  motifs  for  any  merchandise.
    Be  it  apparel  design  or  interior  décor,  our  patterns  can  weave  out  even  the
    outstanding.
- title: INFOGRAPHICS
  description: Visual appeal is the fundamental attraction anywhere. In this world
    or Mars. You might have loads of data lying around, your spreadsheets may be on
    the verge  of  information  overload,  and  perhaps data  mining  could  not  come  to
    your  rescue.  But  you  need  to  make  it  public  and  make your  data  speak.  It
    needs  info graphics,  the  best  no  doubt.  As  we  combine  the  complexity  of
    information and beauty of graphics, we give eyes to unseen. Our tailor made solutions
    will help you visualize even the most complex equations that your data  might  throw  at  you  in  a  seemingly  lucid  fashion.  The  result,  better
    projections, all the time.
- title: GRAPHIC DESIGN
  description: Three  rivers  converge  to  produce  a  distinct  colour  that  cannot  be  described
    by words. Sangam or the confluence of rivers is nature’s another reminder of telling
    us what else needs to be discovered. Graphic design is a revelation of that  confluence.  As  it  weds
    high  end  graphics  and  far  ends  of  design,  our visual artists put together
    every conceivable imagination into the canvas and produce  path  breaking impressions,  that  can  be  created  for  every  challenge
    that design demands. It is a complete package, so full of suspense and refined
    creativity, it makes a vision become celestial.
