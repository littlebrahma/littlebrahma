  description: We use human behavioural studies, psychology and multiple analytical
    tools to define what our users might like and provide them with what they want.
    We have realised long back that in today’s world, you cannot define the behaviour

    We try to merge functionality with pleasurable user experience and build marketing
    processes around it, rather than the other way around.
